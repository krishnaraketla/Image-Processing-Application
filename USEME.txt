Introduction

This controller implements the PPM Image Model, which allows the user to load, save, and transform images. The following commands are supported:

load: loads an image file
save: saves an image file
greyscale: converts an image to greyscale
horizontal-flip: flips an image horizontally
vertical-flip: flips an image vertically
rgb-split: splits an image into its RGB components
rgb-combine: combines an image from its RGB components
brighten: increases the brightness of an image
darken: decreases the brightness of an image
dither: applies a dither effect to an image
blur: applies a blur filter to an image
sharpen: applies a sharpen filter to an image
sepia: applies a sepia tone effect to an image
run: executes a file containing a sequence of commands
exit: exits the application


Command syntax

Execute a file from command line:
Java -jar res/Assignment04.jar -file <script-file-name>
java -jar res/Assignment04.jar -file res/script.txt

Launch GUI
java -jar res/Assignment04.jar

Launch App in text mode
java -jar res/Assignment04.jar -text

Lau

load command
load <input-file-path> <output-file-path>
Loads an image from the given input file path and saves it to the given output file path.

save command
save <input-file-path> <output-file-path>
Saves an image from the given input file path to the given output file path.

greyscale command
greyscale <value-component> <input-file-path> <output-file-path>
Converts an image to greyscale. The value-component parameter determines the algorithm used for conversion, and can be one of the following:

red-component: uses the red component of the RGB color model to determine the greyscale value
blue-component: uses the blue component of the RGB color model to determine the greyscale value
green-component: uses the green component of the RGB color model to determine the greyscale value
value-component: uses the value component of the HSV color model to determine the greyscale value
luma-component: uses the luma component of the YUV color model to determine the greyscale value

horizontal-flip command
horizontal-flip <input-file-path> <output-file-path>
Flips an image horizontally.

vertical-flip command
vertical-flip <input-file-path> <output-file-path>
Flips an image vertically.

rgb-split command
rgb-split <red-output-image> <green-output-image> <blue-output-image> <input-image>
Splits an image into its RGB components and saves each component to a separate file.

rgb-combine command
rgb-combine <red-input-image> <green-input-image> <blue-input-image> <output-image>
Combines the RGB components from separate files into a single image.

brighten command
brighten <increment> <input-image-name> <output-image-name>
Increases the brightness of an image by the given increment.

darken command
darken <value> <input-image-name> <output-image-name>
Decreases the brightness of an image by the given value.

dither command
dither <input-image-name> <output-image-name>
Applies a dither effect to an image.

blur command
blur <input-image-name> <output-image-name>
Applies a Blur effect to an image

Sepia command
sepia <input-image-name> <output-image-name>
Applies a sepia tone effect to an image

Run command
run <script-path>
executes a file containing a sequence of commands

Exit command
exit
Quits the application
