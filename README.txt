Changes in Design:


1. Added a new interface EnhancedModel that extends the improvedModel to provide the histogram feature
2. Enhanced Model implementation extends the Abstract Model class. Objects changed to create object of this class in necessary places
3. GUIView class implementation of the View interface
4. AbstractController implementation of Controller interface
5. GUIController implementation extends the AbstractController
6. This class uses the same functionality of the old Controller, but has a few additional capabilities
